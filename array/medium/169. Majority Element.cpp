class Solution {
public:
    // Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm
    
    // we know that we will be having majority element in our array 
    // so count of majority element - other elements will always be positive
    // because question states that majority element means which element occurs more than n/2 
    // that's why we use moore's voting algorithm 
    // in this algorithm just take two variables as count and element 
    // if count == 0 than change the element as arr[i]
    // if element == arr[i] increase count 
    // else decrease count
    // finally we will be having element as our majority element
